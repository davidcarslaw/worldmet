`worldmet` provides an easy way to access hourly data from the [Global Historical Climatology Network](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/global-historical-climatology-network-hourly) (GHCNh). The GHCN contains detailed surface
meteorological data from around the world.

The package outputs work very well with the [openair](https://github.com/davidcarslaw/openair) package.

## Installation

You can install the release version of `{worldmet}` from CRAN with:

``` r
install.packages("worldmet")
```

You can install the development version of `{worldmet}` from GitHub with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("davidcarslaw/worldmet")
```

## Documentation

All functions in `{worldmet}` are thoroughly documented. The [worldmet website](https://davidcarslaw.github.io/worldmet/) contains all documentation and a change log of new features. There are also many examples of `{worldmet}` functionality the [openair book](https://bookdown.org/david_carslaw/openair/index.html), which goes into great detail about its various functions.

```{r import}
library(worldmet)

importGHCNstations(country = "FR", return = "table")

importGHCNhourly("FRW00034048", 2021)
```


## The `{openair}` toolkit

-   [`{openair}`](https://davidcarslaw.github.io/openair/): Import, analyse, and visualise air quality and atmospheric composition data.

-   [`{worldmet}`](https://davidcarslaw.github.io/worldmet/): Access world meteorological data from NOAA's Integrated Surface Database.

-   [`{openairmaps}`](https://davidcarslaw.github.io/openairmaps/): Visualise air quality data on interactive and static maps.

-   [`{deweather}`](https://davidcarslaw.github.io/deweather/): Use machine learning to remove the effects of meteorology on air quality time series.
